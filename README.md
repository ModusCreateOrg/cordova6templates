# Cordova 6 Template Demo

Supporting Github repo for [this blog post](http://moduscreate.com/new-in-cordova-6-app-templates-using-git/) about Cordova 6's new ability to use a template app from Github when creating a new app.

Requires Cordova 6.0.0 or higher.

Contains two simple template apps based on themes by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/), each of which are on their own branch here:

* #template1 based on the [Heroic](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/heroic-features/) Start Bootstrap template
* #template2 baed on the [One Page Wonder](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/one-page-wonder/) Start Bootstrap template

Both templates use the [Cordova Device Orientation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-device-orientation) plugin to show basic integration with a Cordova plugin.
